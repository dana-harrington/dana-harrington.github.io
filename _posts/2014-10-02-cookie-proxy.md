In this article I'll show how we can use a monad to automatically marshall cookies through a intermediate system. This will allow the intermediate system to proxy web service calls from a user through to a backend system. The monad will have two advantages, it will allow us to focus our attention on the request/response bodies, and it will allow us to chain together multiple back end web services requests to service a single front end request.
